# **Introduction to Deep Learning**
Welcome to the Deep Learning course! In our introductory approach, we will use [Keras](https://keras.io/guides/functional_api/)’ functional API, a Deep Learning *“building blocks”* composed of the [TensorFlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow) framework. Additionally, we will delve into the mathematical underpinnings of artificial neural networks to better understand how to construct and enhance our models.

## Contents
The whole course is divided into two modules. Their contents may change throughout the classes to meet the public's needs.

##### Module I:
* Deep Learning workflow;
* Basic math of neural network modeling and training;
* Tasks: classification, regression, clusterization, (fine-tuning);
* Dense, Convolutional, and Recurrent layers;
* Dataset types: dataframe, images, time-series, counts table.

##### Module II:
* Object oriented programming in Python (OOP);
* Tensorflow/PyTorch OOP;
* Generative models: GAN, VAE;
* Graph Neural Network (GNN);
* Large Language Models (LLMs);
* Model fine-tuning;
* Model interpretability.

## Required Python modules
Please make sure to install the following Python modules for this course (pip install *module-name*):

* **numpy**
* **scipy**
* **pandas**
* **matplotlib**
* **tensorflow**
